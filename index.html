	<p> Mapping Amazon's Acquisition of Whole Foods 
<br>
			</p>
	</font>

		<p>
			Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods seems odd at first glance.
			<a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2014/10/17/so-amazon-thinks-it-can-do-retail">
			Analysts have speculated for years</a> 
			that Amazon would expand to real-life retail, but the company focused on its own Amazon-branded 
			stores. 
			This project explores one of the main reasons for Amazon's Whole Foods purchase, the geographic
			footprint it instantly gained.<br><br>
			As the map below shows, Amazon's current fufillment centers tend to be at the edges of urban areas. Although 
			these locations have low real estate costs and easy highway access, 	
			physical stores have lower delivery times
			and transportation costs. In fact, one of the biggest costs for online retailers is "the last mile" 
			or the distance between fufillment centers and individual customers' homes. 
			 
			<br><br>
			Suddenly having 400+ mostly urban and 
			high-income locations was likely a key force behind Amazon's decision. 
			Unlike Amazon and most national grocery chains, Whole Foods locations are almost exclusively 
			in urban and high-income areas. 
			In theory, Amazon could have built its own network of hundreds of prime (no pun intended)
			real estate locations in the next few years, but it would likely have had to pay a premium.			
			In other words, once Amazon decided to expand to real-life stores within the next few years, 
			acquiring Whole Foods was one of only a handful of options.

		 Amazon fufillment center locations come from 
	<a href="https://github.com/sonnenglas/amazon-fba-fulfillment-center-list/issues">this CSV file</a>.
		 The Python script also finds the geo coordinates of the Amazon locations.
		 Finally, R's Leaflet package produces the map.

	<p> Network graph of the S&P
<br>
</p>
	</font>
<p>

The below network graph comes from a network science class, I was curious to see if an underlying structure linked the world's top 
	companies. 
Node sizes represent market caps of the 100 largest S&P companies and links represent competitive relationships 
	between companies according to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/">MarketWatch.com</a>.
Identifying competitors is inherently subjective, from my research, MarketWatch appears to have the most thorough competitor data. 
A full SP500 graph is <a href="https://dfield18.github.io/SP-Network-Map/sp500.html">here</a>.

</iframe>

<p> 
		<ul> A few initial insights are:
 		 <li> The SP100 network has four main clusters: financial services, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and tech. </li>

		<li> MasterCard and 3M each connect two of the industry clusters. MasterCard, which links the financial and 
			tech clusters, is arguably a tech company 
		in that it has partnered with Google and AT&T on mobile payment products. 
		3M, which links manufacturing with tech, is debatebly a competitor of Apple in that 3M produces touch screens and 
			multimedia projectors. </li>

		<li> For the SP500 graph, GE has the highest degree (number of competitor links) at 26, followed by Microsoft at 23 </li>

		<li> The company with the highest degree centrality (a measure of a node's closeness to all other nodes in the network) 
			is again GE at .056, followed by Microsoft at .046.

		<li> The correlation between nodes' degrees (each nodes' numbers of links) and size (market cap) is .31 for 
			both the SP100 and SP500. </li>

		<br>
		Technical detials:
		<br>

			A Python script scrapes this <a href="http://slickcharts.com/sp500">website</a> 
			for market cap sizes, the script scrapes <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/">MarketWatch.com</a>
			for data on company's competitors.
			The Python library NetworkX generates a JSON file of nodes and links. 
		 The JavaScript D3 visualization library creates the graph.	
			The D3 graph is adapted from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler">http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler</a>.

			This project maps GOP gains between the 2012 and 16 elections. 
			Red areas represent counties with a greater support for the Republican presidential candidate 
			in 2016 than in 2012. Blue areas represent counties with a 
			lower percent of votes for the presdienial Republican candidate (although, as in the case of Utah,

  <li>The map confirms the belief that Trump’s base lies is Appalachia and the Midwest. I was surprised though 
  to see that Rebublicans received a major bump in support in northern New England.</li>
  <li>The only county that swung by more than 15% for the GOP in 2016 and cast over 20,000 votes 
	was Scioto County, Ohio. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/04/news/economy/america-left-behind-white-men/index.html"> 
    CNN posted an interesting profile</a> of Scioto County in May of last year. 
	According to the story, “only 53.8% of men [in Scioto] age 16 to 64 are employed” 
	and less than 15% of residents are college graduates. </li>
	<li> A number of majority Hispanic counties near the US-Mexico border swung from 
	extremely Democrat to moderately Democrat in 2016. For example, in Duval County, Texas, which is 96% Hispanic,
	support for the GOP candidate in 2016 jumped by	9% in 2016. </li>
	<li> Only three regions had no swing towards the GOP in 2016: the Boston-DC corridor, southern California and Utah.

	<p> Visualizing County Voting Changes   
<br>
			</p>
	</font>
	
	</p> 
	
		<p>
	In addition to geographic trends, I was curious about which demographic and economic variables are tied to
	changes in votes between the presidential elections. 
	I created a regression model that predicts the change in the percent of GOP votes between 2012 and 16.
	The model uses publically availible voting data from 
			<a href="http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president">Politico</a>
	and demographic and economic data from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election"> 
			the US Census</a>. All data is at the county level. 
	Although individual precint (voting location) data is publically availible, 
			there is surprisingly no central database of results from all
	precients. 
	<br><br>
	The regression model confirms news that counties’ racial makeups, education levels, and 
			economic conditions predict 
	voting behavior in last year's election. Plots of demographic variables' correlation with 2012-16 voting changes 
			and the full regression model are below.

		<br><br>
		<p>
		Methodology: <br> 
		I removed all variables with P-values greater than .05. To avoid correlation between 
		predictive variables, I also removed variable for the percent of white residents.  
		This data point is already accounted for by the percent of resident of other racial backgrounds. 
		<br><br>
		The reason the adjusted R-squared value isn’t higher is that certain cultural variables, 
			such as religion, are not collected in the Census data. 
		For example, a variable capturing the percent of residents identifying as Mormon would likely forecast
			2012 GOP voters not supporting Trump.
