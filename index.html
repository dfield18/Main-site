			This project examines which geographic, demographic and economic variables best explain changes 
			in support for the Republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. 
			I am partly interested in whether the media narrative of white working class support boosting 
			Trump is grounded in empirical evidence. I am also curious how successful a regression model can be 
			in predicting net changes in support for the GOP from 2012 to 2016.  <br><br>
			
			To visualize evolving voter preferences geographically, I created a map highlighting changes 
			in the voting habits between the two elections. Red areas represent counties with a higher percent of 
			votes for the Republican candidates in 2016 than in 2012. Blue areas represent counties with a 
			lower percent of votes for the Republican candidate (although, as in the case of Utah, not necessarily 
			greater support for the Democratic candidate).  <br><br>

	The map confirms that Trump’s base lies is Appalachia, the Midwest and northern New England. 
	In fact, the only county that swung by more than 15% for the GOP in 2016 and cast over 20,000 votes 
	was Scioto County, Ohio. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/04/news/economy/america-left-behind-white-men/index.html" </a>
        CNN had an interesting profile on Scioto County in May of last year. 
	According to the story, “only 53.8% of men [in Scioto] age 16 to 64 are employed” 
	and less than 15% of residents are college graduates. <br><br>
	
	Interestingly, a number if majority Hispanic counties near the US-Mexico border swung from 
	extremely Democrat to moderately Democrat in 2016. For example, support for the GOP candidate in 2016 jumped by 
	9% in Duval County, Texas, which is 96% Hispanic. <br><br>
	
	I was also surprised to see that only three regions had no swing towards the GOP in 2016: 
	the Boston-DC corridor, southern California and Utah.

SP index network graph</font>
<br><br>
<font size="3">
This chart shows competitive relationships between SP100 companies.
Node sizes represent <a href="http://slickcharts.com/sp500/">market caps</a>.
<br>	
<br>							       
Links represent competitive relationships between companies according to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/">MarketWatch.com</a>									  
Identifying competitors is inherently subjective, from my research, MarketWatch appears to have the most thorough competitor data.
<br> <br> <br> 
A few quick observations:
<br><br> 
The network has four main clusters: financial services, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and tech.   														      
<br><br>
MasterCard and 3M each connect two of the industry clusters. MasterCard, which connects the finanical and tech 
clusters, is arguably a tech company in that it has partnered with Google and AT&T on mobile payment products. 
Other credit card companies have not focused on mobile payment products to the same extent. 
3M, which links manufacturing with tech, is debately a competitor of Apple in that 3M produces touch screens and multimedia projectors.
<br><br>
There is correlation between nodes' degress (each nodes' numbers of links) and size (market cap).															
																																											
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>												      														     
Technical details: 
<br>
A Python script scrapes websites for SP100 companies, market cap sizes and competitive data. 
The Python library NetworkX generates a JSON file of nodes and links. The JavaScript D3 visualization library creates the graph.															     
The D3 graph is adapted from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler">http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler</a>.
