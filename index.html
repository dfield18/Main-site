			This project examines which geographic, demographic and economic variables best explain changes in support 
			for the Republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. I am partly interested in whether the media 
			narrative of white working class support boosting Trump is grounded in empirical evidence. 
			I am also curious how successful a regression model can be in predicting net changes in support for the GOP 
			from 2012 to 2016. <br><br>
			
			To visualize evolving voter preferences geographically, I created a map highlighting changes in the voting 
			habits between the two elections. Red areas represent counties with a higher percent of votes for the 
			Republican candidates in 2016 than in 2012. Blue areas represent counties with a lower percent of votes 
			for the Republican candidate (although, as in the case of Utah, not necessarily greater support for the 
			Democratic candidate). <br><br>

SP index network graph</font>
<br><br>
<font size="3">
This chart shows competitive relationships between SP100 companies.
Node sizes represent <a href="http://slickcharts.com/sp500/">market caps</a>.
<br>	
<br>							       
Links represent competitive relationships between companies according to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/">MarketWatch.com</a>									  
Identifying competitors is inherently subjective, from my research, MarketWatch appears to have the most thorough competitor data.
<br> <br> <br> 
A few quick observations:
<br><br> 
The network has four main clusters: financial services, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and tech.   														      
<br><br>
MasterCard and 3M each connect two of the industry clusters. MasterCard, which connects the finanical and tech 
clusters, is arguably a tech company in that it has partnered with Google and AT&T on mobile payment products. 
Other credit card companies have not focused on mobile payment products to the same extent. 
3M, which links manufacturing with tech, is debately a competitor of Apple in that 3M produces touch screens and multimedia projectors.
<br><br>
There is correlation between nodes' degress (each nodes' numbers of links) and size (market cap).															
																																											
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>												      														     
Technical details: 
<br>
A Python script scrapes websites for SP100 companies, market cap sizes and competitive data. 
The Python library NetworkX generates a JSON file of nodes and links. The JavaScript D3 visualization library creates the graph.															     
The D3 graph is adapted from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler">http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler</a>.
