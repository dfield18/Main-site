Network map of competitive relationships between SP100 companies </font>
<br>	
<br>
<font size="3"> 
Node sizes represent <a href="http://slickcharts.com/sp500/">market caps</a>.
<br>	
<br>							       
Links represent competitive relationships between companies according to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/">MarketWatch.com</a>									  
Identifying competitors is inherently subjective, from my research, MarketWatch seemed to have the most thorough competitor data.
<br> <br> <br> 
A few quick observations:
<br><br> 
The network has three main clusters: tech, pharmaceutical and financial.   														      
<br><br>
MasterCard connects the finanical and tech clusters, MasterCard is arguably a tech company in that it has partnered with Google and
AT&T on mobile payment products. Other credit card companies have not focus on mobile payment products to the same extent. 															      
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br><br> <br> <br>													      														     
Technical details: 
<br>
A Python script scrapes websites for SP100 companies, market cap sizes and competitive data. 
The Python library NetworkX generates a JSON file of nodes and links. The JavaScript D3 visualization library creates the graph.															     
The D3 graph is adapted from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler">http://bl.ocks.org/eyaler</a>.
