On May 6, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan granted a motion ordering the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, to turn over the footage from his movie “Crude” as part of a lawsuit accusing Texaco, now owned by Chevron, of polluting the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador. The company’s lawyers argued that the footage would show misconduct by the other side; Mr. Berlinger’s lawyers argued that his work should be protected under reporter’s privilege. The judge agreed that Mr. Berlinger enjoyed the privilege but ruled that it could be outweighed if the material was not confidential and “likely relevant” to the case. In a contentious hearing on Wednesday over whether the judge would stay his decision, Judge Kaplan made it clear he believed the chances of overturning were slight. In a 20-page opinion issued on Thursday, he wrote that he would not grant the stay but would delay the deadline for enforcing the subpoena from Friday until May 24, allowing all parties time to present arguments to the court of appeals. Lawyers for Mr. Berlinger filed an emergency appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, denouncing Judge Kaplan’s “unprecedented, blunderbuss order” and asking that it be overturned.",1383,1,,,4/13/2012, $100.78 ,5/21/2010, $74.48

An earlier program run by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland of Italy collapsed in 2009 because of technical difficulties and billions of dollars in cost overruns, with President Obama complaining that it was “an example of the procurement process gone amok.” Industry officials said that AgustaWestland, Boeing and Bell Helicopter did not bid this time because they believed that the specifications favored a version of Sikorsky’s S-92 helicopter, which is smaller than most of its rivals. The new contract will cover the development of six aircraft. The Navy, which runs the program, is likely to eventually buy 21 helicopters.
